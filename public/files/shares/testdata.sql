Understanding what they do and don&rsquo;t have in place should be used to develop a scope of work. The more prospects you work with, the more you&rsquo;ll realize that every&nbsp;client&nbsp;is different. Each one is&nbsp;at a different point in their maturity continuum,&nbsp;and they each have&nbsp;a wide range of assets to work with (or around).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Make sure you have all of the access necessary to review their assets.</li>\r\n<li>Make a list of everything you find, both positive and negative, and remember to position the negatives as opportunities for improvement.</li>\r\n<li>When you review your findings, look for opportunities to position yourself as an expert.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>2) Build Your Marketing Plan and Campaign Goals</h2>\r\n<p>A successful campaign starts with a goal and a plan. During the sales cycle, you should have identified what the client is hoping to accomplish. The assessment uncovered what they have to work with and what gaps you need to fill. Now, the goal is to move things forward.</p>\r\n<p>This critical onboarding step involves taking the assessment and turning it into quantifiable campaign goals with a plan your team can execute. The better you clarify the purpose of the campaign with your team and the client&rsquo;s team, the more likely you&rsquo;ll stay aligned throughout.</p>\r\n<p>Make sure:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The scope of work fits your skill sets. Don&rsquo;t get yourself into something you can&rsquo;t deliver on.</li>\r\n<li>You have an accurate enough data set to establish the necessary baseline for the goals.</li>\r\n<li>You build the goals together. They&rsquo;re worthless without buy-in on both sides.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>3) Assign Your Best Team for the Job</h2>\r\n<p>With a firm understanding of what you&rsquo;re up against and how you plan to achieve the established goals, the next step is assigning a&nbsp;team.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"http://www.revenueriver.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Revenue River Marketing</a>, we assign teams of five to every new client. The team consists of a strategist, a coordinator, a search analyst, a designer, and a project Manager. The better our team can relate to our client&rsquo;s team, the smoother the onboarding process will go.</p>\r\n<p>But the most important assignee from an onboarding perspective is the strategist. As the chief point of contact, it&rsquo;s important that the strategist has some commonalities with the client -- if possible. I try to assign the team with the most relevant industry experience and cultural fit first; everything else second. If I&rsquo;m confident that they&rsquo;ll hit it off on a personal note, I&rsquo;m confident that the onboarding process will go smoothly.</p>\r\n<h2>4) Hold an Internal Client Orientation Meeting</h2>\r\n<p>Before your team is involved with the client, you need to brief them on everything that has happened thus far. This meeting is strictly to educate your team on the client, his&nbsp;industry, his&nbsp;products or services, and the scope of work. The team needs to have a thorough understanding of the client\'s goals, and you should prompt them to do a certain amount of prep work for the kickoff call.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You should:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pool together the assessment, contract, and sales meeting notes as a primary handover packet.</li>\r\n<li>Assign specific premium content and blog articles to be read.</li>\r\n<li>Brief your team on everyone on the client&rsquo;s team -- provide&nbsp;LinkedIn profiles and meeting notes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>5) Plan for&nbsp;a Great Kickoff Call</h2>\r\n<p>This is the big first impression, the moment your team and the client&rsquo;s team has been waiting for. It&rsquo;s important for your team to come across as experts. You don&rsquo;t want the client to think you (the owner or business development person) are the only one that knows anything. You team&nbsp;needs to demonstrate their understanding of the job at hand, command their portion of the call, and gather the information they need to move the campaign forward.</p>\r\n<p>Here\'s a sample agenda:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Introductions:</strong> 10 minutes</li>\r\n<li><strong>Campaign Objectives:</strong> 10 minutes</li>\r\n<li><strong>Client Overview:</strong> 20 minutes</li>\r\n<li><strong>Campaign Overview:</strong> 10 minutes</li>\r\n<li><strong>Expectations:</strong> 5 minutes</li>\r\n<li><strong>Next Steps:</strong> 5 minutes&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>6) Do a 30-Day Checkup Call</h2>\r\n<p>This call is designed to be a one-on-one call between myself and the primary decision maker -- I want to talk to the person cutting the checks. Schedule this call to gather feedback on the engagement and relationship so far. It\'s the perfect time to fix it if there is an issue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I also use the call as an opportunity to&nbsp;strengthen our relationship, extend an invitation to the client to contact me directly with anything of concern, and cement our agency\'s commitment to delivering results. Basically, I want the client to know that I care how the agency is doing, if they are happy with the work, and what else they need in a relationship. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Be sure to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Have questions&nbsp;you want answered prepared before the call.</li>\r\n<li>Recap all activity and production during&nbsp;the first 30 days.</li>\r\n<li>Leave the call with the&nbsp;client&nbsp;understanding how much you value your relationship and his&nbsp;business.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>When Onboarding Is Complete</h2>\r\n<p>When I get done with the checkup call, I usually circle back with the strategist to pass on any notes that came up to make sure we&rsquo;re all on the same page. If things are great, I&rsquo;m giving them a high five. If there are issues, the strategist sets a&nbsp;meeting to make corrections.</p>\r\n<p>Once I&rsquo;ve addressed these six elements, I consider the onboarding process complete. It&rsquo;s now time for the team to execute on the campaign, hit the goal, and extend the relationship.</p>',	'2016-08-01 09:30:48',	'2016-08-01 10:20:35'),
(2,	1,	'Team Meeting',	'<h4 class=\"heading heading-grey-mukta-4\">Identify the team</h4>\r\n<p>The composition of the team may vary based on the size of the practice or the medical specialty. In one setting, the team might include two physicians and their medical assistants, nurses and clinic manager. In another setting the team may be one physician, two nurses and a receptionist. Smaller practices may invite the lab or X-ray technician to team meetings. In larger practices, other relevant staff members, such as a social worker and pharmacist, may be included.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"heading heading-grey-mukta-4\">Meet regularly and &ldquo;on‑the‑clock&rdquo;</h4>\r\n<p>Pick a set time to meet during the work day, or &ldquo;on‑the‑clock.&rdquo; Many teams meet for one hour every two weeks. You may find that meeting first thing in the morning results in fewer distractions. When possible, the meeting should occur &ldquo;<a class=\"tooltip tooltipstered\">on‑the‑clock</a>&rdquo; and away from the clinical area to minimize interruptions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"heading heading-grey-mukta-4\">Agree on ground rules</h4>\r\n<p>To form a supportive, respectful environment for your team meeting, establish ground rules from the beginning. Creating your own set of ground rules together and agreeing on them as a team will create buy‑in on team meetings and strengthen teamwork. Signing a charter or statement of purpose can help the team connect with the ground rules and their commitment to the group.</p>',	'2016-08-01 09:30:59',	'2016-08-01 10:21:56'),

Company X has several other caterer options. Caterer W and Caterer Z both offer larger menus and have comparable costs to our existing provider. Furthermore, because Caterer Z offers daily vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free entrees, they could better meet the needs of our workforce. Caterer W offers fewer vegan-specific items but also could be a good choice. A survey completed in 2011 showed that 40% of our employees are vegetarian, 10% are vegan, and 2% are gluten-free.&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong class=\"whb\">Outline a plan.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Describe each step and its related implementation times or costs. Be clear with what you know and what remains to be seen. Consider writing numbered steps. Then offer more details. Do not overestimate the value of your change but do suggest what you think the results could be.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To switch caterers, we will need: 1. To end our contract with Caterer Y 2. Ask Caterers W and Z for trial tastings 3. Choose one of the firms 4. Sign a contract with the chosen firm. The costs should be comparable to our current costs with Caterer Y. As long as we finish our contract term with Caterer Y, there should be no financial penalties.

This is because the two events may fall into different tax years. So always invoice promptly, or as soon as the agreed work has been completed.</p>\r\n<p>Invoicing should become a fundamental part of your business operations.

And can they find it easily?</p>\r\n<p>A hungry panther doesn&rsquo;t like wasting time to catch a meal. And your web visitors don&rsquo;t want to browse around your website for several long minutes to find the product they&rsquo;re after. They want to find it quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Just like the panther makes a fast decision whether to follow a scent trail or not, your web visitor decides quickly whether your site is useful or not. So if your site looks complicated with a lot of options to choose from, they click away to check out another website.</p>\r\n<p>Web visitors quickly glance at your web page before guessing whether they&rsquo;re in the right place or not. They don&rsquo;t need to know for sure. They just want to make a quick decision.</p>\r\n<p>If your web visitors only glance at your website, how do you get your message across?</p>\r\n<h2>2.

Mention your most important information first.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Writing for the web is completely different than writing an essay or a paper.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An essay might go like this: First, explain what you&rsquo;re going to discuss. Then, present an overview of the literature. Next, discuss; and finally draw your conclusion. The most important point you make is in the conclusion &ndash; at the end of your essay!</p>\r\n<p>On web pages you have to do the opposite: your most important points always come first.</p>\r\n<p>An example: you&rsquo;re looking for a new red three-seater sofa. When you arrive at a website you want to see it sells sofas. And secondly, you want a search box so you know you can quickly find out what the red three-seater sofas are like.</p>\r\n<p>Or say you&rsquo;re looking for a copywriter for your website. Maybe you&rsquo;re looking for someone local, so you need to see a copywriter is based in Manchester which is nearby. Or maybe your copywriter needs to understand medical terminology, so you like to see a headline like<em>copywriting for the medical industry</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Information that&rsquo;s most important to your web visitors is often a simple statement of what you do. Once they understand what you do, they might want to know some important details. And then &ndash; maybe they&rsquo;d like to know some background information.</p>\r\n<p>Journalists call this way of writing <strong>the inverted pyramid</strong>. In newspaper articles the most newsworthy information comes first before details and background information. Even if you only read the first paragraph of a newspaper story you still understand the big picture.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the same on your website. Your customers want to know the big picture first.

(6,	1,	'Wireframe',	'<p><a href=\"https://gomockingbird.com/home\">https://gomockingbird.com/home</a></p>\r\n<h2>1. Know the level</h2>\r\n<p>By definition, ours at least anyway, a wireframe is a &lsquo;visual representation of a user interface&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s a lot in that, so it&rsquo;s important to understand how &lsquo;real&rsquo; a wireframe needs to be:</p>\r\n<h3>Sketches</h3>\r\n<p>How do sketches help you? First of all, they are <strong>quick</strong> and <strong>easy to iterate</strong>. They also enable <strong>experimentation</strong> and are a great solution if you want to receive rapid <strong>feedback</strong>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Lo-fidelity</h3>\r\n<p>How do lo-fi wireframes help you? They&rsquo;re good for <strong>blocking out key content areas</strong> and <strong>testing the flow</strong> within and across pages. They can be also <strong>clickable</strong>, which is great for testing.</p>\r\n<h3>Hi-fidelity</h3>\r\n<p>How do hi-fidelity wireframes help you? They&rsquo;re great because they shouldn&rsquo;t need explanation. They contain <strong>detailed content</strong>, show the <strong>intended behaviours</strong> and are often <strong>clickable</strong>. Hi-fidelity wireframes take longer to create, but they give the chance to get <strong>detailed feedback</strong> from users.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Cover the basics</h2>\r\n<p>What is the business looking to achieve with its new website, what are the objectives?</p>\r\n<p>Who are the intended users and what are their needs and goals?</p>\r\n<p>What does the business want the user to do?</p>\r\n<p>In the excitement of creating visual design or writing code these questions are often overlooked. The answers are fundamental though. The better your understanding the greater the chance you&rsquo;ll design something valuable.</p>\r\n<h2>3. List the elements</h2>\r\n<p>Identify the pages on the site by walking through the steps the user goes through to meet the desired actions or tasks. Now list the page elements - thestandard ones, such as headers, footers, content areas, menus. And the non-standard ones, such as a calendar, RSS feed or Twitter feed.</p>\r\n<p>A matrix can be a useful way of seeing at a glance, which elements go on what page.</p>\r\n<h2>4. Remember you&rsquo;re a user&nbsp;too</h2>\r\n<p>Whilst you may not have a wealth of wireframing experience, you do have a lot of experience of being a visitor to a site. Draw upon the sites you hold in high regard - why do they work, can you do what you need to quicker or easy, maybe it&rsquo;s just enjoyable to use.</p>\r\n<p>And what about those sites that drive you crazy - is it because they don&rsquo;t seem to get you? Maybe things are in strange places or the process for doing what you need to seems to long or complicated.</p>\r\n<p>Have a look at the landscape, the comparator sites in your sector as well as those in others. Inspiration comes from surprising places, so cast the net wide then see what you think works well or could be improved.</p>\r\n<h2>5. Get your thoughts down</h2>\r\n<p>There are a lot of options for creating wireframes. These range from pencil and paper sketches to tools for creating real life web pages.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of the wireframe should inform the approach you take. Sketches work well in an internal setting &nbsp;(which can include clients). In an external setting, Protoshare or Visio can help you produce something more suitable.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Sweat the insights</h2>\r\n<p>Website analytics and customer enquiries (amongst others) can be a rich source of intelligence. Having data on the popular content, as well as what and how customers ask for help means you have a source to check your recommendations against. User research also has a key part to play and can fit well by providing the stories behind the number, i.e. the why to the what.</p>\r\n<h2>Boiling it all down</h2>\r\n<p>The most important thing is to know what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve for the business and the users.</p>\r\n<p>Identify elements by stepping through user journeys.</p>\r\n<p>Draw upon your own experiences of what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n<p>Roll your sleeves up and start creating, then share with others and reiterate.</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll end up with a site that not only looks good, but functions well and satisfies the needs of your users.</p>',	'2016-08-01 09:32:43',	'2016-08-01 10:31:12'),

If your host doesn&rsquo;t provide cPanel, please check out this <a title=\"WordPress Backup Post At The Codex\" href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups#Database_Backup_Instructions\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress backup post at the Codex</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>Create regular backups depending on the frequency of posting to your WordPress site. If you post 50+ posts per day, you need to create backups more regularly than the guy who posts once a month. Other than that, consider checking if your web host offers a reliable backup solution.</p>\r\n<p>Moving on, let&rsquo;s automate WordPress backups using a couple of nifty WordPress backup plugins. I&rsquo;m all for manual backups because that way you&rsquo;re in complete control. All the same, here&rsquo;s a great list of the best WordPress plugins out there.</p>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>',	'2016-08-02 10:28:24',	'2016-08-02 10:28:24'),
(11,	1,	'Manual File Back up',	'<h2>Backing Up Your WordPress Files Manually</h2>\r\n<p>Your WordPress directory contains sub-folders e.g. wp-content, wp-includes etc and files e.g. wp-config.php, theme and plugin files etc required by your WordPress site. The wp-content folder contains all your themes, plugins, cache and uploads among other things. You cannot afford to lose this data.&nbsp;The wp-admin carries all the files required by your WordPress admin area, so you can&rsquo;t afford to lose this as well. The wp-includes folder contains WordPress core files. This is the folder where all the major WordPress code lives. You definitely don&rsquo;t want to lose this code.</p>\r\n<p>To create a copy of your WordPress files, you just need to download your entire WordPress directory. How?&nbsp;You can login to your server via cPanel or using a FTP program such <a title=\"FileZilla\" href=\"https://filezilla-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FileZilla</a>&nbsp;or<a title=\"Transmit\" href=\"https://panic.com/transmit/\" target=\"_blank\">Transmit</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Backup Your WordPress Site via cPanel</h2>\r\n<p>This is so easy you can do it in the time it takes to brew a mug of coffee. Here&rsquo;s the procedure:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Login to your web host and navigate to cPanel. For most web hosts, the cPanel is usually the first page you encounter when you login</li>\r\n<li>Navigate to the File Manager, which should lead you to your&nbsp;<em>public_html&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Home&nbsp;</em>directory</li>\r\n<li>From here, just locate your WordPress directory. This is the folder you&nbsp;want&nbsp;to backup</li>\r\n<li>Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t download the WordPress folder in File Manager without first compressing it. Worry not though, compressing a folder needn&rsquo;t be challenging</li>\r\n<li>Click on your WordPress directory, and select <em>Compress&nbsp;</em>from the menu bar. Alternatively, right-click on the folder and choose&nbsp;<em>Compress&nbsp;</em>from the drop-down options menu that appears</li>\r\n<li>Choose the compression type e.g. ZIP, Tar, GZIP etc from the dialog box that opens. I always go with a ZIP archive</li>\r\n<li>Then just hit the&nbsp;<em>Compress File(s)&nbsp;</em>button and wait for the process to run its course. Your server will save your compressed WordPress folder</li>\r\n<li>Click on the archive you just created and choose&nbsp;<em>Download&nbsp;</em>from the menu. Alternatively, right-click on the archive and choose&nbsp;<em>Download.</em></li>\r\n<li>Choose a secure location on your hard disk and save your backup</li>\r\n<li>And that&rsquo;s it!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>Upload the backup to your Dropbox account, Google Drive, burn it to a DVD/CD, email it etc &ndash; just make sure you have several copies to ensure you don&rsquo;t lose your site should one of the backup dies.</p>\r\n<p>If your web host uses a different control panel e.g. vDeck, Plesk, etc, you just need to locate your File Manager, and just follow the process i.e.&nbsp;<strong>Locate File Manager -&gt; Locate your WordPress directory -&gt; Compress -&gt; Download. </strong>Repeat regularly.</p>\r\n<h2>Backing up Your WordPress Files using FTP</h2>\r\n<p>I use, love and recommend <a title=\"FileZilla\" href=\"https://filezilla-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FileZilla</a> because it&rsquo;s lightweight and easy to use. All you have to do is login to your&nbsp;server, locate your WordPress directory, and download the files to your computer. Oh by the way, you need a FTP account to use FTP, which should be easy to set up from FTP manager in your cPanel. Simple as ABC. Don&rsquo;t forget to make copies of your backups.</p>',	'2016-08-02 10:29:37',	'2016-08-02 10:29:37'),

Then move on to gathering all the items that do NOT&nbsp;belong in the kitchen. Put all these items into a basket to be put away later (or if you have a helper, enlist their help with this.)

Use a long-handled duster and work your way around the entire perimeter of the room. Clean the corners, the light fixtures, and the tops of the cabinets. Don&rsquo;t forget the top of the refrigerator. When you&rsquo;ve worked your way back to where you started, you&rsquo;re ready to move on.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-29168 pib-hover-img\" src=\"http://onegoodthingbyjillee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Clean-Your-Kitchen-17.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" srcset=\"http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Clean-Your-Kitchen-17.jpg 350w, http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Clean-Your-Kitchen-17-300x248.jpg 300w\" alt=\"Clean Your Kitchen \" width=\"350\" height=\"289\" /></p>\r\n<h3>6. Wipe Down Upper Cabinets &amp; Clean Microwave</h3>\r\n<p>Set a wet sponge in the microwave and &ldquo;cook&rdquo; for 2 minutes. While the microwave is doing it&rsquo;s work, dip a rag in the warm, soap water and use it to wipe down the doors and pulls of the upper cabinets and anything else on the wall as you circle the room. The sponge in the microwave should be cool enough to handle now. Use it to wipe down the inside and outside of the microwave.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-29162 pib-hover-img\" src=\"http://onegoodthingbyjillee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Clean-Your-Kitchen-12.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" srcset=\"http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Clean-Your-Kitchen-12.jpg 350w, http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Clean-Your-Kitchen-12-300x201.jpg 300w\" alt=\"Clean Your Kitchen \" width=\"350\" height=\"234\" /></p>\r\n<h3>7. Wipe Down Countertops and Stovetop</h3>\r\n<p>Now that the cleaner has had a chance to work, wipe down the horizontal surfaces.

Pay close attention to handles and outside edges. (Use my <a href=\"http://onegoodthingbyjillee.com/2012/04/how-to-clean-your-stainless-steel.html\" target=\"_blank\">Stainless Steel Cleaner</a> or vinegar diluted with water for stainless steel appliances.)</p>\r\n<h2><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-29161 pib-hover-img\" src=\"http://onegoodthingbyjillee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Clean-Your-Kitchen-11.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" srcset=\"http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Clean-Your-Kitchen-11.jpg 350w, http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Clean-Your-Kitchen-11-300x267.jpg 300w\" alt=\"Clean Your Kitchen \" width=\"350\" height=\"311\" /></h2>\r\n<h3>9.
